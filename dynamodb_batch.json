   "Discussion": "Access control policy and procedures address the controls in the AC family that are implemented within systems and organizations. The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate on the development of access control policy and procedures. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable in general and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs for mission or business processes and for systems if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to access control policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings security or privacy incidents or changes in laws executive orders directives regulations policies standards and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.",

   "Discussion": "Examples of system account types include individual shared group system guest anonymous emergency developer temporary and service. Identification of authorized system users and the specification of access privileges reflect the requirements in other controls in the security plan. Users requiring administrative privileges on system accounts receive additional scrutiny by organizational personnel responsible for approving such accounts and privileged access including system owner mission or business owner senior agency information security officer or senior agency official for privacy. Types of accounts that organizations may wish to prohibit due to increased risk include shared group emergency anonymous temporary and guest accounts.\nWhere access involves personally identifiable information security programs collaborate with the senior agency official for privacy to establish the specific conditions for group and role membership; specify authorized users group and role membership and access authorizations for each account; and create adjust or remove system accounts in accordance with organizational policies. Policies can include such information as account expiration dates or other factors that trigger the disabling of accounts. Organizations may choose to define access privileges or other attributes by account type of account or a combination of the two. Examples of other attributes required for authorizing access include restrictions on time of day day of week and point of origin. In defining other system account attributes organizations consider system-related requirements and mission/business requirements. Failure to consider these factors could affect system availability.\nTemporary and emergency accounts are intended for short-term use. Organizations establish temporary accounts as part of normal account activation procedures when there is a need for short-term accounts without the demand for immediacy in account activation. Organizations establish emergency accounts in response to crisis situations and with the need for rapid account activation. Therefore emergency account activation may bypass normal account authorization processes. Emergency and temporary accounts are not to be confused with infrequently used accounts including local logon accounts used for special tasks or when network resources are unavailable (may also be known as accounts of last resort). Such accounts remain available and are not subject to automatic disabling or removal dates. Conditions for disabling or deactivating accounts include when shared/group emergency or temporary accounts are no longer required and when individuals are transferred or terminated. Changing shared/group authenticators when members leave the group is intended to ensure that former group members do not retain access to the shared or group account. Some types of system accounts may require specialized training.",

Dynamic privilege management can also include mechanisms that change user privileges based on dynamic rules as opposed to editing specific user profiles. Examples include automatic adjustments of user privileges if they are operating out of their normal work times if their job function or assignment changes or if systems are under duress or in emergency situations.

   "Discussion": "Mandatory access control is a type of nondiscretionary access control. Mandatory access control policies constrain what actions subjects can take with information obtained from objects for which they have already been granted access. This prevents the subjects from passing the information to unauthorized subjects and objects. Mandatory access control policies constrain actions that subjects can take with respect to the propagation of access control privileges; that is a subject with a privilege cannot pass that privilege to other subjects. The policy is uniformly enforced over all subjects and objects to which the system has control. Otherwise the access control policy can be circumvented. This enforcement is provided by an implementation that meets the reference monitor concept as described in AC-25. The policy is bounded by the system (i.e. once the information is passed outside of the control of the system additional means may be required to ensure that the constraints on the information remain in effect).\nThe trusted subjects described above are granted privileges consistent with the concept of least privilege (see AC-6). Trusted subjects are only given the minimum privileges necessary for satisfying organizational mission/business needs relative to the above policy. The control is most applicable when there is a mandate that establishes a policy regarding access to controlled unclassified information or classified information and some users of the system are not authorized access to all such information resident in the system. Mandatory access control can operate in conjunction with discretionary access control as described in AC-3(4). A subject constrained in its operation by mandatory access control policies can still operate under the less rigorous constraints of AC-3(4) but mandatory access control policies take precedence over the less rigorous constraints of AC-3(4). For example while a mandatory access control policy imposes a constraint that prevents a subject from passing information to another subject operating at a different impact or classification level AC-3(4) permits the subject to pass the information to any other subject with the same impact or classification level as the subject. Examples of mandatory access control policies include the Bell-LaPadula policy to protect confidentiality of information and the Biba policy to protect the integrity of information.",

   "Discussion": "When discretionary access control policies are implemented subjects are not constrained with regard to what actions they can take with information for which they have already been granted access. Thus subjects that have been granted access to information are not prevented from passing the information to other subjects or objects (i.e. subjects have the discretion to pass). Discretionary access control can operate in conjunction with mandatory access control as described in AC-3(3) and AC-3(15). A subject that is constrained in its operation by mandatory access control policies can still operate under the less rigorous constraints of discretionary access control. Therefore while AC-3(3) imposes constraints that prevent a subject from passing information to another subject operating at a different impact or classification level AC-3(4) permits the subject to pass the information to any subject at the same impact or classification level.

When users are assigned to specific roles they inherit the authorizations or privileges defined for those roles. RBAC simplifies privilege administration for organizations because privileges are not assigned directly to every user (which can be a large number of individuals) but are instead acquired through role assignments. RBAC can also increase privacy and security risk if individuals assigned to a role are given access to information beyond what they need to support organizational missions or business functions.

Additional controls may be needed to ensure that organizational information is adequately protected once it is transmitted outside of the system. In situations where the system is unable to determine the adequacy of the protections provided by external entities as a mitigating control organizations procedurally determine whether the external systems are providing adequate controls. The means used to determine the adequacy of controls provided by external systems include conducting periodic assessments (inspections/tests) establishing agreements between the organization and its counterpart organizations or some other process. The means used by external entities to protect the information received need not be the same as those used by the organization but the means employed are sufficient to provide consistent adjudication of the security and privacy policy to protect the information and individuals� privacy.\nControlled release of information requires systems to implement technical or procedural means to validate the information prior to releasing it to external systems.

Organizations can create rules based on attributes and the authorizations (i.e. privileges) to perform needed operations on the systems associated with organization-defined attributes and rules. When users are assigned to attributes defined in attribute-based access control policies or rules they can be provisioned to a system with the appropriate privileges or dynamically granted access to a protected resource. Attribute-based access control can be implemented as either a mandatory or discretionary form of access control. When implemented with mandatory access controls the requirements in AC-3(3) define the scope of the subjects and objects covered by the policy.",

   "Discussion": "Information flow control regulates where information can travel within a system and between systems (in contrast to who is allowed to access the information) and without regard to subsequent accesses to that information. Flow control restrictions include blocking external traffic that claims to be from within the organization keeping export-controlled information from being transmitted in the clear to the Internet restricting web requests that are not from the internal web proxy server and limiting information transfers between organizations based on data structures and content. Transferring information between organizations may require an agreement specifying how the information flow is enforced (see CA-3). Transferring information between systems in different security or privacy domains with different security or privacy policies introduces the risk that such transfers violate one or more domain security or privacy policies. In such situations information owners/stewards provide guidance at designated policy enforcement points between connected systems. Organizations consider mandating specific architectural solutions to enforce specific security and privacy policies. Enforcement includes prohibiting information transfers between connected systems (i.e. allowing access only) verifying write permissions before accepting information from another security or privacy domain or connected system employing hardware mechanisms to enforce one-way information flows and implementing trustworthy regrading mechanisms to reassign security or privacy attributes and labels.\nOrganizations commonly employ information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms to control the flow of information between designated sources and destinations within systems and between connected systems. Flow control is based on the characteristics of the information and/or the information path. Enforcement occurs for example in boundary protection devices that employ rule sets or establish configuration settings that restrict system services provide a packet-filtering capability based on header information or provide a message-filtering capability based on message content. Organizations also consider the trustworthiness of filtering and/or inspection mechanisms (i.e. hardware firmware and software components) that are critical to information flow enforcement. Control enhancements 3 through 32 primarily address cross-domain solution needs that focus on more advanced filtering techniques in-depth analysis and stronger flow enforcement mechanisms implemented in cross-domain products such as high-assurance guards. Such capabilities are generally not available in commercial off-the-shelf products. Information flow enforcement also applies to control plane traffic (e.g. routing and DNS).",

A dataset of personally identifiable information may be tagged with restrictions against combining with other types of datasets and thus would not be allowed to flow to the restricted dataset.

Internal data structures can represent different types of entities both active and passive. Active entities also known as subjects are typically associated with individuals devices or processes acting on behalf of individuals. Passive entities also known as objects are typically associated with data structures such as records buffers tables files inter-process pipes and communications ports. Security attributes a form of metadata are abstractions that represent the basic properties or characteristics of active and passive entities with respect to safeguarding information. Privacy attributes which may be used independently or in conjunction with security attributes represent the basic properties or characteristics of active or passive entities with respect to the management of personally identifiable information. Attributes can be either explicitly or implicitly associated with the information contained in organizational systems or system components.\nAttributes may be associated with active entities (i.e. subjects) that have the potential to send or receive information cause information to flow among objects or change the system state. These attributes may also be associated with passive entities (i.e. objects) that contain or receive information. The association of attributes to subjects and objects by a system is referred to as binding and is inclusive of setting the attribute value and the attribute type. Attributes when bound to data or information permit the enforcement of security and privacy policies for access control and information flow control including data retention limits permitted uses of personally identifiable information and identification of personal information within data objects. Such enforcement occurs through organizational processes or system functions or mechanisms. The binding techniques implemented by systems affect the strength of attribute binding to information. Binding strength and the assurance associated with binding techniques play important parts in the trust that organizations have in the information flow enforcement process. The binding techniques affect the number and degree of additional reviews required by organizations. The content or assigned values of attributes can directly affect the ability of individuals to access organizational information.\nOrganizations can define the types of attributes needed for systems to support missions or business functions. There are many values that can be assigned to a security attribute. By specifying the permitted attribute ranges and values organizations ensure that attribute values are meaningful and relevant. Labeling refers to the association of attributes with the subjects and objects represented by the internal data structures within systems. This facilitates system-based enforcement of information security and privacy policies. Labels include classification of information in accordance with legal and compliance requirements (e.g. top secret secret confidential controlled unclassified) information impact level; high value asset information access authorizations nationality; data life cycle protection (i.e. encryption and data expiration) personally identifiable information processing permissions including individual consent to personally identifiable information processing and contractor affiliation. A related term to labeling is marking. Marking refers to the association of attributes with objects in a human-readable form and displayed on system media. Marking enables manual procedural or process-based enforcement of information security and privacy policies. Security and privacy labels may have the same value as media markings (e.g. top secret secret confidential). See MP-3 (Media Marking).",

Establish configuration requirements connection requirements and implementation guidance for organization-controlled mobile devices to include when such devices are outside of controlled areas; and\nb.

   "Discussion": "A mobile device is a computing device that has a small form factor such that it can easily be carried by a single individual; is designed to operate without a physical connection; possesses local non-removable or removable data storage; and includes a self-contained power source. Mobile device functionality may also include voice communication capabilities on-board sensors that allow the device to capture information and/or built-in features for synchronizing local data with remote locations. Examples include smart phones and tablets. Mobile devices are typically associated with a single individual. The processing storage and transmission capability of the mobile device may be comparable to or merely a subset of notebook/desktop systems depending on the nature and intended purpose of the device. Protection and control of mobile devices is behavior or policy-based and requires users to take physical action to protect and control such devices when outside of controlled areas. Controlled areas are spaces for which organizations provide physical or procedural controls to meet the requirements established for protecting information and systems.\nDue to the large variety of mobile devices with different characteristics and capabilities organizational restrictions may vary for the different classes or types of such devices. Usage restrictions and specific implementation guidance for mobile devices include configuration management device identification and authentication implementation of mandatory protective software scanning devices for malicious code updating virus protection software scanning for critical software updates and patches conducting primary operating system (and possibly other resident software) integrity checks and disabling unnecessary hardware.\nUsage restrictions and authorization to connect may vary among organizational systems. For example the organization may authorize the connection of mobile devices to the organizational network and impose a set of usage restrictions while a system owner may withhold authorization for mobile device connection to specific applications or impose additional usage restrictions before allowing mobile device connections to a system. Adequate security for mobile devices goes beyond the requirements specified in AC-19. Many controls for mobile devices are reflected in other controls allocated to the initial control baselines as starting points for the development of security plans and overlays using the tailoring process. There may also be some overlap by the security controls within the different families of controls. AC-20 addresses mobile devices that are not organization-controlled.",

Data storage objects include database records and database fields. Sensitive information can be extracted from data mining operations. When information is personally identifiable information it may lead to unanticipated revelations about individuals and give rise to privacy risks. Prior to performing data mining activities organizations determine whether such activities are authorized. Organizations may be subject to applicable laws executive orders directives regulations or policies that address data mining requirements. Organizational personnel consult with the senior agency official for privacy and legal counsel regarding such requirements.\nData mining prevention and detection techniques include limiting the number and frequency of database queries to increase the work factor needed to determine the contents of databases limiting types of responses provided to database queries applying differential privacy techniques or homomorphic encryption and notifying personnel when atypical database queries or accesses occur. Data mining protection focuses on protecting information from data mining while such information resides in organizational data stores. In contrast AU-13 focuses on monitoring for organizational information that may have been mined or otherwise obtained from data stores and is available as open-source information residing on external sites such as social networking or social media websites.\nEO 13587 requires the establishment of an insider threat program for deterring detecting and mitigating insider threats including the safeguarding of sensitive information from exploitation compromise or other unauthorized disclosure. Data mining protection requires organizations to identify appropriate techniques to prevent and detect unnecessary or unauthorized data mining.

A reference validation mechanism is always invoked tamper-proof and small enough to be subject to analysis and tests the completeness of which can be assured (i.e. verifiable). Information is represented internally within systems using abstractions known as data structures. Internal data structures can represent different types of entities both active and passive. Active entities also known as subjects are associated with individuals devices or processes acting on behalf of individuals. Passive entities also known as objects are associated with data structures such as records buffers communications ports tables files and inter-process pipes. Reference monitors enforce access control policies that restrict access to objects based on the identity of subjects or groups to which the subjects belong. The system enforces the access control policy based on the rule set established by the policy. The tamper-proof property of the reference monitor prevents determined adversaries from compromising the functioning of the reference validation mechanism. The always invoked property prevents adversaries from bypassing the mechanism and violating the security policy. The smallness property helps to ensure completeness in the analysis and testing of the mechanism to detect any weaknesses or deficiencies (i.e. latent flaws) that would prevent the enforcement of the security policy.",

   "Discussion": "An event is an observable occurrence in a system. The types of events that require logging are those events that are significant and relevant to the security of systems and the privacy of individuals. Event logging also supports specific monitoring and auditing needs. Event types include password changes failed logons or failed accesses related to systems security or privacy attribute changes administrative privilege usage PIV credential usage data action changes query parameters or external credential usage. In determining the set of event types that require logging organizations consider the monitoring and auditing appropriate for each of the controls to be implemented. For completeness event logging includes all protocols that are operational and supported by the system.\nTo balance monitoring and auditing requirements with other system needs event logging requires identifying the subset of event types that are logged at a given point in time. For example organizations may determine that systems need the capability to log every file access successful and unsuccessful but not activate that capability except for specific circumstances due to the potential burden on system performance. The types of events that organizations desire to be logged may change. Reviewing and updating the set of logged events is necessary to help ensure that the events remain relevant and continue to support the needs of the organization. Organizations consider how the types of logging events can reveal information about individuals that may give rise to privacy risk and how best to mitigate such risks. For example there is the potential to reveal personally identifiable information in the audit trail especially if the logging event is based on patterns or time of usage.\nEvent logging requirements including the need to log specific event types may be referenced in other controls and control enhancements. These include AC-2(4) AC-3(10) AC-6(9) AC-17(1) CM-3f CM-5(1) IA-3(3.b) MA-4(1) MP-4(2) PE-3 PM-21 PT-7 RA-8 SC-7(9) SC-7(15) SI-3(8) SI-4(22) SI-7(8) and SI-10(1). Organizations include event types that are required by applicable laws executive orders directives policies regulations standards and guidelines. Audit records can be generated at various levels including at the packet level as information traverses the network. Selecting the appropriate level of event logging is an important part of a monitoring and auditing capability and can identify the root causes of problems. When defining event types organizations consider the logging necessary to cover related event types such as the steps in distributed transaction-based processes and the actions that occur in service-oriented architectures.",

To achieve impartiality assessors do not create a mutual or conflicting interest with the organizations where the assessments are being conducted assess their own work act as management or employees of the organizations they are serving or place themselves in positions of advocacy for the organizations acquiring their services.\nIndependent assessments can be obtained from elements within organizations or be contracted to public or private sector entities outside of organizations. Authorizing officials determine the required level of independence based on the security categories of systems and/or the risk to organizational operations organizational assets or individuals. Authorizing officials also determine if the level of assessor independence provides sufficient assurance that the results are sound and can be used to make credible risk-based decisions. Assessor independence determination includes whether contracted assessment services have sufficient independence such as when system owners are not directly involved in contracting processes or cannot influence the impartiality of the assessors conducting the assessments. During the system design and development phase having independent assessors is analogous to having independent SMEs involved in design reviews.\nWhen organizations that own the systems are small or the structures of the organizations require that assessments be conducted by individuals that are in the developmental operational or management chain of the system owners independence in assessment processes can be achieved by ensuring that assessment results are carefully reviewed and analyzed by independent teams of experts to validate the completeness accuracy integrity and reliability of the results. Assessments performed for purposes other than to support authorization decisions are more likely to be useable for such decisions when performed by assessors with sufficient independence thereby reducing the need to repeat assessments.",

The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate on the development of configuration management policy and procedures. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable in general and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs for mission/business processes and for systems if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to configuration management policy and procedures include but are not limited to assessment or audit findings security or privacy incidents or changes in applicable laws executive orders directives regulations policies standards and guidelines.

   "Discussion": "Contingency planning for systems is part of an overall program for achieving continuity of operations for organizational mission and business functions. Contingency planning addresses system restoration and implementation of alternative mission or business processes when systems are compromised or breached. Contingency planning is considered throughout the system development life cycle and is a fundamental part of the system design. Systems can be designed for redundancy to provide backup capabilities and for resilience. Contingency plans reflect the degree of restoration required for organizational systems since not all systems need to fully recover to achieve the level of continuity of operations desired. System recovery objectives reflect applicable laws executive orders directives regulations policies standards guidelines organizational risk tolerance and system impact level.\nActions addressed in contingency plans include orderly system degradation system shutdown fallback to a manual mode alternate information flows and operating in modes reserved for when systems are under attack. By coordinating contingency planning with incident handling activities organizations ensure that the necessary planning activities are in place and activated in the event of an incident. Organizations consider whether continuity of operations during an incident conflicts with the capability to automatically disable the system as specified in IR-4(5). Incident response planning is part of contingency planning for organizations and is addressed in the IR (Incident Response) family.",

Organizations may restrict the use of portable storage devices for example by using physical cages on workstations to prohibit access to certain external ports or disabling or removing the ability to insert read or write to such devices. Organizations may also limit the use of portable storage devices to only approved devices including devices provided by the organization devices provided by other approved organizations and devices that are not personally owned. Finally organizations may restrict the use of portable storage devices based on the type of device such as by prohibiting the use of writeable portable storage devices and implementing this restriction by disabling or removing the capability to write to such devices. Requiring identifiable owners for storage devices reduces the risk of using such devices by allowing organizations to assign responsibility for addressing known vulnerabilities in the devices.",

The control documentation describes how system-specific and hybrid controls are implemented and the plans and expectations regarding the functionality of the system. System security and privacy plans can also be used in the design and development of systems in support of life cycle-based security and privacy engineering processes. System security and privacy plans are living documents that are updated and adapted throughout the system development life cycle (e.g. during capability determination analysis of alternatives requests for proposal and design reviews). Section 2.1 describes the different types of requirements that are relevant to organizations during the system development life cycle and the relationship between requirements and controls.\nOrganizations may develop a single integrated security and privacy plan or maintain separate plans. Security and privacy plans relate security and privacy requirements to a set of controls and control enhancements. The plans describe how the controls and control enhancements meet the security and privacy requirements but do not provide detailed technical descriptions of the design or implementation of the controls and control enhancements.

   "Discussion": "The security and privacy architectures at the system level are consistent with the organization-wide security and privacy architectures described in PM-7 which are integral to and developed as part of the enterprise architecture. The architectures include an architectural description the allocation of security and privacy functionality (including controls) security- and privacy-related information for external interfaces information being exchanged across the interfaces and the protection mechanisms associated with each interface. The architectures can also include other information such as user roles and the access privileges assigned to each role; security and privacy requirements; types of information processed stored and transmitted by the system; supply chain risk management requirements; restoration priorities of information and system services; and other protection needs.\nSP 800-160-1 provides guidance on the use of security architectures as part of the system development life cycle process. OMB M-19-03 requires the use of the systems security engineering concepts described in SP 800-160-1 for high value assets. Security and privacy architectures are reviewed and updated throughout the system development life cycle from analysis of alternatives through review of the proposed architecture in the RFP responses to the design reviews before and during implementation (e.g. during preliminary design reviews and critical design reviews).\nIn today�s modern computing architectures it is becoming less common for organizations to control all information resources. There may be key dependencies on external information services and service providers. Describing such dependencies in the security and privacy architectures is necessary for developing a comprehensive mission and business protection strategy. Establishing developing documenting and maintaining under configuration control a baseline configuration for organizational systems is critical to implementing and maintaining effective architectures. The development of the architectures is coordinated with the senior agency information security officer and the senior agency official for privacy to ensure that the controls needed to support security and privacy requirements are identified and effectively implemented. In many circumstances there may be no distinction between the security and privacy architecture for a system. In other circumstances security objectives may be adequately satisfied but privacy objectives may only be partially satisfied by the security requirements. In these cases consideration of the privacy requirements needed to achieve satisfaction will result in a distinct privacy architecture. The documentation however may simply reflect the combined architectures.\nPL-8 is primarily directed at organizations to ensure that architectures are developed for the system and moreover that the architectures are integrated with or tightly coupled to the enterprise architecture. In contrast SA-17 is primarily directed at the external information technology product and system developers and integrators. SA-17 which is complementary to PL-8 is selected when organizations outsource the development of systems or components to external entities and when there is a need to demonstrate consistency with the organization�s enterprise architecture and security and privacy architectures.",

Unintended consequences can include system lockout and cascading alarms. The placement of controls in systems and organizations is an important activity that requires thoughtful analysis.

Centrally managed controls and processes may also meet independence requirements for assessments in support of initial and ongoing authorizations to operate and as part of organizational continuous monitoring.\nAutomated tools (e.g. security information and event management tools or enterprise security monitoring and management tools) can improve the accuracy consistency and availability of information associated with centrally managed controls and processes. Automation can also provide data aggregation and data correlation capabilities; alerting mechanisms; and dashboards to support risk-based decision-making within the organization.\nAs part of the control selection processes organizations determine the controls that may be suitable for central management based on resources and capabilities.

Proper position designation is the foundation of an effective and consistent suitability and personnel security program. The Position Designation System (PDS) assesses the duties and responsibilities of a position to determine the degree of potential damage to the efficiency or integrity of the service due to misconduct of an incumbent of a position and establishes the risk level of that position. The PDS assessment also determines if the duties and responsibilities of the position present the potential for position incumbents to bring about a material adverse effect on national security and the degree of that potential effect which establishes the sensitivity level of a position. The results of the assessment determine what level of investigation is conducted for a position. Risk designations can guide and inform the types of authorizations that individuals receive when accessing organizational information and information systems. Position screening criteria include explicit information security role appointment requirements. Parts 1400 and 731 of Title 5 Code of Federal Regulations establish the requirements for organizations to evaluate relevant covered positions for a position sensitivity and position risk designation commensurate with the duties and responsibilities of those positions.",

Impact-level prioritization and the resulting sub-categories of the system give organizations an opportunity to focus their investments related to security control selection and the tailoring of control baselines in responding to identified risks. Impact-level prioritization can also be used to determine those systems that may be of heightened interest or value to adversaries or represent a critical loss to the federal enterprise sometimes described as high value assets. For such high value assets organizations may be more focused on complexity aggregation and information exchanges.

   "Discussion": "Security categorization of information and systems guides the frequency and comprehensiveness of vulnerability monitoring (including scans). Organizations determine the required vulnerability monitoring for system components ensuring that the potential sources of vulnerabilities�such as infrastructure components (e.g. switches routers guards sensors) networked printers scanners and copiers�are not overlooked. The capability to readily update vulnerability monitoring tools as new vulnerabilities are discovered and announced and as new scanning methods are developed helps to ensure that new vulnerabilities are not missed by employed vulnerability monitoring tools. The vulnerability monitoring tool update process helps to ensure that potential vulnerabilities in the system are identified and addressed as quickly as possible. Vulnerability monitoring and analyses for custom software may require additional approaches such as static analysis dynamic analysis binary analysis or a hybrid of the three approaches. Organizations can use these analysis approaches in source code reviews and in a variety of tools including web-based application scanners static analysis tools and binary analyzers.\nVulnerability monitoring includes scanning for patch levels; scanning for functions ports protocols and services that should not be accessible to users or devices; and scanning for flow control mechanisms that are improperly configured or operating incorrectly. Vulnerability monitoring may also include continuous vulnerability monitoring tools that use instrumentation to continuously analyze components. Instrumentation-based tools may improve accuracy and may be run throughout an organization without scanning. Vulnerability monitoring tools that facilitate interoperability include tools that are Security Content Automated Protocol (SCAP)-validated. Thus organizations consider using scanning tools that express vulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming convention and that employ the Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL) to determine the presence of vulnerabilities. Sources for vulnerability information include the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) listing and the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). Control assessments such as red team exercises provide additional sources of potential vulnerabilities for which to scan. Organizations also consider using scanning tools that express vulnerability impact by the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS).\nVulnerability monitoring includes a channel and process for receiving reports of security vulnerabilities from the public at-large. Vulnerability disclosure programs can be as simple as publishing a monitored email address or web form that can receive reports including notification authorizing good-faith research and disclosure of security vulnerabilities. Organizations generally expect that such research is happening with or without their authorization and can use public vulnerability disclosure channels to increase the likelihood that discovered vulnerabilities are reported directly to the organization for remediation.\nOrganizations may also employ the use of financial incentives (also known as �bug bounties�) to further encourage external security researchers to report discovered vulnerabilities. Bug bounty programs can be tailored to the organization�s needs. Bounties can be operated indefinitely or over a defined period of time and can be offered to the general public or to a curated group. Organizations may run public and private bounties simultaneously and could choose to offer partially credentialed access to certain participants in order to evaluate security vulnerabilities from privileged vantage points.",

Organizations can use attack trees to show how hostile activities by adversaries interact and combine to produce adverse impacts or negative consequences to systems and organizations. Such information together with correlated data from vulnerability scanning tools can provide greater clarity regarding multi-vulnerability and multi-hop attack vectors. The correlation of vulnerability scanning information is especially important when organizations are transitioning from older technologies to newer technologies (e.g. transitioning from IPv4 to IPv6 network protocols). During such transitions some system components may inadvertently be unmanaged and create opportunities for adversary exploitation.",

   "Discussion": "A privacy impact assessment is an analysis of how personally identifiable information is handled to ensure that handling conforms to applicable privacy requirements determine the privacy risks associated with an information system or activity and evaluate ways to mitigate privacy risks. A privacy impact assessment is both an analysis and a formal document that details the process and the outcome of the analysis.\nOrganizations conduct and develop a privacy impact assessment with sufficient clarity and specificity to demonstrate that the organization fully considered privacy and incorporated appropriate privacy protections from the earliest stages of the organization�s activity and throughout the information life cycle. In order to conduct a meaningful privacy impact assessment the organization�s senior agency official for privacy works closely with program managers system owners information technology experts security officials counsel and other relevant organization personnel. Moreover a privacy impact assessment is not a time-restricted activity that is limited to a particular milestone or stage of the information system or personally identifiable information life cycles. Rather the privacy analysis continues throughout the system and personally identifiable information life cycles. Accordingly a privacy impact assessment is a living document that organizations update whenever changes to the information technology changes to the organization�s practices or other factors alter the privacy risks associated with the use of such information technology.\nTo conduct the privacy impact assessment organizations can use security and privacy risk assessments. Organizations may also use other related processes that may have different names including privacy threshold analyses. A privacy impact assessment can also serve as notice to the public regarding the organization�s practices with respect to privacy. Although conducting and publishing privacy impact assessments may be required by law organizations may develop such policies in the absence of applicable laws. For federal agencies privacy impact assessments may be required by EGOV; agencies should consult with their senior agency official for privacy and legal counsel on this requirement and be aware of the statutory exceptions and OMB guidance relating to the provision.",

For example criticality analysis is a key tenet of supply chain risk management and informs the prioritization of protection activities. The identification of critical system components and functions considers applicable laws executive orders regulations directives policies standards system functionality requirements system and component interfaces and system and component dependencies. Systems engineers conduct a functional decomposition of a system to identify mission-critical functions and components. The functional decomposition includes the identification of organizational missions supported by the system decomposition into the specific functions to perform those missions and traceability to the hardware software and firmware components that implement those functions including when the functions are shared by many components within and  external to the system.\nThe operational environment of a system or a system component may impact the criticality including the connections to and dependencies on cyber-physical systems devices system-of-systems and outsourced IT services. System components that allow unmediated access to critical system components or functions are considered critical due to the inherent vulnerabilities that such components create. Component and function criticality are assessed in terms of the impact of a component or function failure on the organizational missions that are supported by the system that contains the components and functions.\nCriticality analysis is performed when an architecture or design is being developed modified or upgraded. If such analysis is performed early in the system development life cycle organizations may be able to modify the system design to reduce the critical nature of these components and functions such as by adding redundancy or alternate paths into the system design. Criticality analysis can also influence the protection measures required by development contractors. In addition to criticality analysis for systems system components and system services criticality analysis of information is an important consideration. Such analysis is conducted as part of security categorization in RA-2.",

The integration of security and privacy considerations early in the system development life cycle is a foundational principle of systems security engineering and privacy engineering. To apply the required controls within the system development life cycle requires a basic understanding of information security and privacy threats vulnerabilities adverse impacts and risk to critical mission and business functions. The security engineering principles in SA-8 help individuals properly design code and test systems and system components. Organizations include qualified personnel (e.g. senior agency information security officers senior agency officials for privacy security and privacy architects and security and privacy engineers) in system development life cycle processes to ensure that established security and privacy requirements are incorporated into organizational systems. Role-based security and privacy training programs can ensure that individuals with key security and privacy roles and responsibilities have the experience skills and expertise to conduct assigned system development life cycle activities.\nThe effective integration of security and privacy requirements into enterprise architecture also helps to ensure that important security and privacy considerations are addressed throughout the system life cycle and that those considerations are directly related to organizational mission and business processes. This process also facilitates the integration of the information security and privacy architectures into the enterprise architecture consistent with the risk management strategy of the organization.

Assurance requirements include development processes procedures and methodologies as well as the evidence from development and assessment activities that provide grounds for confidence that the required functionality is implemented and possesses the required strength of mechanism. SP 800-160-1 describes the process of requirements engineering as part of the system development life cycle.\nControls can be viewed as descriptions of the safeguards and protection capabilities appropriate for achieving the particular security and privacy objectives of the organization and for reflecting the security and privacy requirements of stakeholders.

Modularity serves to isolate functions and related data structures into well-defined logical units. Layering allows the relationships of these units to be better understood so that dependencies are clear and undesired complexity can be avoided. The security design principle of modularity extends functional modularity to include considerations based on trust trustworthiness privilege and security policy.

The need for resource sharing can be motivated by the design principle of least common mechanism in the case of internal entities or driven by stakeholder requirements. However internal sharing is carefully designed to avoid performance and covert storage and timing channel problems. Sharing via common mechanism can increase the susceptibility of data and information to unauthorized access disclosure use or modification and can adversely affect the inherent capability provided by the system. To minimize sharing induced by common mechanisms such mechanisms can be designed to be reentrant or virtualized to preserve separation.

   "Discussion": "The principle of reduced complexity states that the system design is as simple and small as possible. A small and simple design is more understandable more analyzable and less prone to error. The reduced complexity principle applies to any aspect of a system but it has particular importance for security due to the various analyses performed to obtain evidence about the emergent security property of the system. For such analyses to be successful a small and simple design is essential. Application of the principle of reduced complexity contributes to the ability of system developers to understand the correctness and completeness of system security functions. It also facilitates the identification of potential vulnerabilities. The corollary of reduced complexity states that the simplicity of the system is directly related to the number of vulnerabilities it will contain; that is simpler systems contain fewer vulnerabilities. An benefit of reduced complexity is that it is easier to understand whether the intended security policy has been captured in the system design and that fewer vulnerabilities are likely to be introduced during engineering development. An additional benefit is that any such conclusion about correctness completeness and the existence of vulnerabilities can be reached with a higher degree of assurance in contrast to conclusions reached in situations where the system design is inherently more complex. Transitioning from older technologies to newer technologies (e.g. transitioning from IPv4 to IPv6) may require implementing the older and newer technologies simultaneously during the transition period.

Although it is not possible to plan for every aspect of system evolution system upgrades and changes can be anticipated by analyses of mission or business strategic direction anticipated changes in the threat environment and anticipated maintenance and sustainment needs. It is unrealistic to expect that complex systems remain secure in contexts not envisioned during development whether such contexts are related to the operational environment or to usage. A system may be secure in some new contexts but there is no guarantee that its emergent behavior will always be secure. It is easier to build trustworthiness into a system from the outset and it follows that the sustainment of system trustworthiness requires planning for change as opposed to adapting in an ad hoc or non-methodical manner.

This principle enables the composition of components such that trustworthiness is not inadvertently diminished and the trust is not consequently misplaced. Ultimately this principle demands some metric by which the trust in a component and the trustworthiness of a component can be measured on the same abstract scale. The principle of trusted components is particularly relevant when considering systems and components in which there are complex chains of trust dependencies. A trust dependency is also referred to as a trust relationship and there may be chains of trust relationships.\nThe principle of trusted components also applies to a compound component that consists of subcomponents (e.g. a subsystem) which may have varying levels of trustworthiness. The conservative assumption is that the trustworthiness of a compound component is that of its least trustworthy subcomponent. It may be possible to provide a security engineering rationale that the trustworthiness of a particular compound component is greater than the conservative assumption. However any such rationale reflects logical reasoning based on a clear statement of the trustworthiness objectives as well as relevant and credible evidence. The trustworthiness of a compound component is not the same as increased application of defense-in-depth layering within the component or a replication of components. Defense-in-depth techniques do not increase the trustworthiness of the whole above that of the least trustworthy component.",

   "Discussion": "The principle of hierarchical trust for components builds on the principle of trusted components and states that the security dependencies in a system will form a partial ordering if they preserve the principle of trusted components. The partial ordering provides the basis for trustworthiness reasoning or an assurance case (assurance argument) when composing a secure system from heterogeneously trustworthy components. To analyze a system composed of heterogeneously trustworthy components for its trustworthiness it is essential to eliminate circular dependencies with regard to the trustworthiness. If a more trustworthy component located in a lower layer of the system were to depend on a less trustworthy component in a higher layer this would in effect put the components in the same �less trustworthy� equivalence class per the principle of trusted components. Trust relationships or chains of trust can have various manifestations. For example the root certificate of a certificate hierarchy is the most trusted node in the hierarchy whereas the leaves in the hierarchy may be the least trustworthy nodes. Another example occurs in a layered high-assurance system where the security kernel (including the hardware base) which is located at the lowest layer of the system is the most trustworthy component. The principle of hierarchical trust however does not prohibit the use of overly trustworthy components. There may be cases in a system of low trustworthiness where it is reasonable to employ a highly trustworthy component rather than one that is less trustworthy (e.g. due to availability or other cost-benefit driver). For such a case any dependency of the highly trustworthy component upon a less trustworthy component does not degrade the trustworthiness of the resulting low-trust system.",

The principle of minimized security elements has two aspects: the overall cost of security analysis and the complexity of security analysis. Trusted components are generally costlier to construct and implement owing to the increased rigor of development processes. Trusted components require greater security analysis to qualify their trustworthiness. Thus to reduce the cost and decrease the complexity of the security analysis a system contains as few trustworthy components as possible. The analysis of the interaction of trusted components with other components of the system is one of the most important aspects of system security verification. If the interactions between components are unnecessarily complex the security of the system will also be more difficult to ascertain than one whose internal trust relationships are simple and elegantly constructed.

   "Discussion": "The principle of least privilege states that each system component is allocated sufficient privileges to accomplish its specified functions but no more. Applying the principle of least privilege limits the scope of the component�s actions which has two desirable effects: the security impact of a failure corruption or misuse of the component will have a minimized security impact and the security analysis of the component will be simplified. Least privilege is a pervasive principle that is reflected in all aspects of the secure system design. Interfaces used to invoke component capability are available to only certain subsets of the user population and component design supports a sufficiently fine granularity of privilege decomposition. For example in the case of an audit mechanism there may be an interface for the audit manager who configures the audit settings; an interface for the audit operator who ensures that audit data is safely collected and stored; and finally yet another interface for the audit reviewer who only has need to view the audit data that has been collected but no need to perform operations on that data.\nIn addition to its manifestations at the system interface least privilege can be used as a guiding principle for the internal structure of the system itself. One aspect of internal least privilege is to construct modules so that only the elements encapsulated by the module are directly operated on by the functions within the module. Elements external to a module that may be affected by the module�s operation are indirectly accessed through interaction (e.g. via a function call) with the module that contains those elements. Another aspect of internal least privilege is that the scope of a given module or component includes only those system elements that are necessary for its functionality and that the access modes for the elements (e.g. read write) are minimal.",

The design options for such a mechanism may require simultaneous action (e.g. the firing of a nuclear weapon requires two different authorized individuals to give the correct command within a small time window) or a sequence of operations where each successive action is enabled by some prior action but no single individual is able to enable more than one action.",

No assurances that the system can provide the confidentiality integrity availability and privacy protections for its design capability can be made if there are gaps in the protection. Any assurances about the ability to secure a delivered capability require that data and information are continuously protected. That is there are no periods during which data and information are left unprotected while under control of the system (i.e. during the creation storage processing or communication of the data and information as well as during system initialization execution failure interruption and shutdown). Continuous protection requires adherence to the precepts of the reference monitor concept (i.e. every request is validated by the reference monitor; the reference monitor is able to protect itself from tampering; and sufficient assurance of the correctness and completeness of the mechanism can be ascertained from analysis and testing) and the principle of secure failure and recovery (i.e. preservation of a secure state during error fault failure and successful attack; preservation of a secure state during recovery to normal degraded or alternative operational modes).\nContinuous protection also applies to systems designed to operate in varying configurations including those that deliver full operational capability and degraded-mode configurations that deliver partial operational capability. The continuous protection principle requires that changes to the system security policies be traceable to the operational need that drives the configuration and be verifiable (i.e. it is possible to verify that the proposed changes will not put the system into an insecure state). Insufficient traceability and verification may lead to inconsistent states or protection discontinuities due to the complex or undecidable nature of the problem. The use of pre-verified configuration definitions that reflect the new security policy enables analysis to determine that a transition from old to new policies is essentially atomic and that any residual effects from the old policy are guaranteed to not conflict with the new policy. The ability to demonstrate continuous protection is rooted in the clear articulation of life cycle protection needs as stakeholder security requirements.",

   "Discussion": "The principle of secure metadata management states that metadata are �first class� objects with respect to security policy when the policy requires either complete protection of information or that the security subsystem be self-protecting. The principle of secure metadata management is driven by the recognition that a system subsystem or component cannot achieve self-protection unless it protects the data it relies on for correct execution. Data is generally not interpreted by the system that stores it. It may have semantic value (i.e. it comprises information) to users and programs that process the data. In contrast metadata is information about data such as a file name or the date when the file was created. Metadata is bound to the target data that it describes in a way that the system can interpret but it need not be stored inside of or proximate to its target data. There may be metadata whose target is itself metadata (e.g. the classification level or impact level of a file name) including self-referential metadata.\nThe apparent secondary nature of metadata can lead to neglect of its legitimate need for protection resulting in a violation of the security policy that includes the exfiltration of information. A particular concern associated with insufficient protections for metadata is associated with multilevel secure (MLS) systems. MLS systems mediate access by a subject to an object based on relative sensitivity levels. It follows that all subjects and objects in the scope of control of the MLS system are either directly labeled or indirectly attributed with sensitivity levels. The corollary of labeled metadata for MLS systems states that objects containing metadata are labeled. As with protection needs assessments for data attention is given to ensure that the confidentiality and integrity protections are individually assessed specified and allocated to metadata as would be done for mission business and system data.",

   "Discussion": "The principle of self-analysis states that a system component is able to assess its internal state and functionality to a limited extent at various stages of execution and that this self-analysis capability is commensurate with the level of trustworthiness invested in the system. At the system level self-analysis can be achieved through hierarchical assessments of trustworthiness established in a bottom-up fashion. In this approach the lower-level components check for data integrity and correct functionality (to a limited extent) of higher-level components. For example trusted boot sequences involve a trusted lower-level component that attests to the trustworthiness of the next higher-level components so that a transitive chain of trust can be established. At the root a component attests to itself which usually involves an axiomatic or environmentally enforced assumption about its integrity. Results of the self-analyses can be used to guard against externally induced errors internal malfunction or transient errors. By following this principle some simple malfunctions or errors can be detected without allowing the effects of the error or malfunction to propagate outside of the component. Further the self-test can be used to attest to the configuration of the component detecting any potential conflicts in configuration with respect to the expected configuration.",

   "Discussion": "The principle of accountability and traceability states that it is possible to trace security-relevant actions (i.e. subject-object interactions) to the entity on whose behalf the action is being taken. The principle of accountability and traceability requires a trustworthy infrastructure that can record details about actions that affect system security (e.g. an audit subsystem). To record the details about actions the system is able to uniquely identify the entity on whose behalf the action is being carried out and also record the relevant sequence of actions that are carried out. The accountability policy also requires that audit trail itself be protected from unauthorized access and modification. The principle of least privilege assists in tracing the actions to particular entities as it increases the granularity of accountability. Associating specific actions with system entities and ultimately with users and making the audit trail secure against unauthorized access and modifications provide non-repudiation because once an action is recorded it is not possible to change the audit trail. Another important function that accountability and traceability serves is in the routine and forensic analysis of events associated with the violation of security policy. Analysis of audit logs may provide additional information that may be helpful in determining the path or component that allowed the violation of the security policy and the actions of individuals associated with the violation of the security policy.",

   "Discussion": "The principle of secure defaults states that the default configuration of a system (including its constituent subsystems components and mechanisms) reflects a restrictive and conservative enforcement of security policy. The principle of secure defaults applies to the initial (i.e. default) configuration of a system as well as to the security engineering and design of access control and other security functions that follow a �deny unless explicitly authorized� strategy. The initial configuration aspect of this principle requires that any �as shipped� configuration of a system subsystem or system component does not aid in the violation of the security policy and can prevent the system from operating in the default configuration for those cases where the security policy itself requires configuration by the operational user.\nRestrictive defaults mean that the system will operate �as-shipped� with adequate self-protection and be able to prevent security breaches before the intended security policy and system configuration is established. In cases where the protection provided by the �as-shipped� product is inadequate stakeholders assess the risk of using it prior to establishing a secure initial state. Adherence to the principle of secure defaults guarantees that a system is established in a secure state upon successfully completing initialization. In situations where the system fails to complete initialization either it will perform a requested operation using secure defaults or it will not perform the operation. Refer to the principles of continuous protection and secure failure and recovery that parallel this principle to provide the ability to detect and recover from failure.\nThe security engineering approach to this principle states that security mechanisms deny requests unless the request is found to be well-formed and consistent with the security policy. The insecure alternative is to allow a request unless it is shown to be inconsistent with the policy. In a large system the conditions that are satisfied to grant a request that is denied by default are often far more compact and complete than those that would need to be checked in order to deny a request that is granted by default.",

   "Discussion": "The principle of secure failure and recovery states that neither a failure in a system function or mechanism nor any recovery action in response to failure leads to a violation of security policy. The principle of secure failure and recovery parallels the principle of continuous protection to ensure that a system is capable of detecting (within limits) actual and impending failure at any stage of its operation (i.e. initialization normal operation shutdown and maintenance) and to take appropriate steps to ensure that security policies are not violated. In addition when specified the system is capable of recovering from impending or actual failure to resume normal degraded or alternative secure operations while ensuring that a secure state is maintained such that security policies are not violated.\nFailure is a condition in which the behavior of a component deviates from its specified or expected behavior for an explicitly documented input. Once a failed security function is detected the system may reconfigure itself to circumvent the failed component while maintaining security and provide all or part of the functionality of the original system or it may completely shut itself down to prevent any further violation of security policies. For this to occur the reconfiguration functions of the system are designed to ensure continuous enforcement of security policy during the various phases of reconfiguration.\nAnother technique that can be used to recover from failures is to perform a rollback to a secure state (which may be the initial state) and then either shutdown or replace the service or component that failed such that secure operations may resume. Failure of a component may or may not be detectable to the components using it. The principle of secure failure indicates that components fail in a state that denies rather than grants access. For example a nominally �atomic� operation interrupted before completion does not violate security policy and is designed to handle interruption events by employing higher-level atomicity and rollback mechanisms (e.g. transactions). If a service is being used its atomicity properties are well-documented and characterized so that the component availing itself of that service can detect and handle interruption events appropriately. For example a system is designed to gracefully respond to disconnection and support resynchronization and data consistency after disconnection.\nFailure protection strategies that employ replication of policy enforcement mechanisms sometimes called defense in depth can allow the system to continue in a secure state even when one mechanism has failed to protect the system. If the mechanisms are similar however the additional protection may be illusory as the adversary can simply attack in series. Similarly in a networked system breaking the security on one system or service may enable an attacker to do the same on other similar replicated systems and services. By employing multiple protection mechanisms whose features are significantly different the possibility of attack replication or repetition can be reduced. Analyses are conducted to weigh the costs and benefits of such redundancy techniques against increased resource usage and adverse effects on the overall system performance. Additional analyses are conducted as the complexity of these mechanisms increases as could be the case for dynamic behaviors. Increased complexity generally reduces trustworthiness. When a resource cannot be continuously protected it is critical to detect and repair any security breaches before the resource is once again used in a secure context.",

   "Discussion": "The principle of performance security states that security mechanisms are constructed so that they do not degrade system performance unnecessarily. Stakeholder and system design requirements for performance and security are precisely articulated and prioritized. For the system implementation to meet its design requirements and be found acceptable to stakeholders (i.e. validation against stakeholder requirements) the designers adhere to the specified constraints that capability performance needs place on protection needs. The overall impact of computationally intensive security services (e.g. cryptography) are assessed and demonstrated to pose no significant impact to higher-priority performance considerations or are deemed to provide an acceptable trade-off of performance for trustworthy protection. The trade-off considerations include less computationally intensive security services unless they are unavailable or insufficient. The insufficiency of a security service is determined by functional capability and strength of mechanism. The strength of mechanism is selected with respect to security requirements performance-critical overhead issues (e.g. cryptographic key management) and an assessment of the capability of the threat.\nThe principle of performance security leads to the incorporation of features that help in the enforcement of security policy but incur minimum overhead such as low-level hardware mechanisms upon which higher-level services can be built. Such low-level mechanisms are usually very specific have very limited functionality and are optimized for performance. For example once access rights to a portion of memory is granted many systems use hardware mechanisms to ensure that all further accesses involve the correct memory address and access mode. Application of this principle reinforces the need to design security into the system from the ground up and to incorporate simple mechanisms at the lower layers that can be used as building blocks for higher-level mechanisms.",

Particular attention is given to interfaces through which personnel responsible for system administration and operation configure and set up the security policies.

Personnel with system administrative and operational responsibilities are able to configure systems before start-up and administer them during runtime with confidence that their intent is correctly mapped to the system�s mechanisms. Security services functions and mechanisms do not impede or unnecessarily complicate the intended use of the system.

First the procedures impose checks and balances on the life cycle process such that the introduction of unspecified functionality is prevented.\nSecond rigorous procedures applied to systems security engineering activities that produce specifications and other system design documents contribute to the ability to understand the system as it has been built rather than trusting that the component as implemented is the authoritative (and potentially misleading) specification.\nFinally modifications to an existing system component are easier when there are detailed specifications that describe its current design instead of studying source code or schematics to try to understand how it works. Procedural rigor helps ensure that security functional and assurance requirements have been satisfied and it contributes to a better-informed basis for the determination of trustworthiness and risk posture.

The principle of reduced complexity applies to any aspect of a system but it has particular importance for security due to the various analyses performed to obtain evidence about the emergent security property of the system. For such analyses to be successful a small and simple design is essential. Application of the principle of reduced complexity contributes to the ability of system developers to understand the correctness and completeness of system security functions and facilitates the identification of potential vulnerabilities. The corollary of reduced complexity states that the simplicity of the system is directly related to the number of vulnerabilities it will contain. That is simpler systems contain fewer vulnerabilities. An important benefit of reduced complexity is that it is easier to understand whether the security policy has been captured in the system design and that fewer vulnerabilities are likely to be introduced during engineering development. An additional benefit is that any such conclusion about correctness completeness and existence of vulnerabilities can be reached with a higher degree of assurance in contrast to conclusions reached in situations where the system design is inherently more complex.",

   "Discussion": "The principle of least privilege states that each component is allocated sufficient privileges to accomplish its specified functions but no more (see SA-8(14)). Applying the principle of least privilege limits the scope of the component�s actions which has two desirable effects. First the security impact of a failure corruption or misuse of the system component results in a minimized security impact. Second the security analysis of the component is simplified. Least privilege is a pervasive principle that is reflected in all aspects of the secure system design. Interfaces used to invoke component capability are available to only certain subsets of the user population and component design supports a sufficiently fine granularity of privilege decomposition. For example in the case of an audit mechanism there may be an interface for the audit manager who configures the audit settings; an interface for the audit operator who ensures that audit data is safely collected and stored; and finally yet another interface for the audit reviewer who only has a need to view the audit data that has been collected but no need to perform operations on that data.\nIn addition to its manifestations at the system interface least privilege can be used as a guiding principle for the internal structure of the system itself. One aspect of internal least privilege is to construct modules so that only the elements encapsulated by the module are directly operated upon by the functions within the module. Elements external to a module that may be affected by the module�s operation are indirectly accessed through interaction (e.g. via a function call) with the module that contains those elements. Another aspect of internal least privilege is that the scope of a given module or component includes only those system elements that are necessary for its functionality and the access modes to the elements (e.g. read write) are minimal.",

Variants can be in software design in hardware design or in both hardware and a software design.

Hardware design diversity includes making different decisions about what information to keep in analog form and what information to convert to digital form transmitting the same information at different times and introducing delays in sampling (temporal diversity).

The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate on the development of system and communications protection policy and procedures. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable in general and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs for mission or business processes and for systems if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to system and communications protection policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings security or privacy incidents or changes in applicable laws executive orders directives regulations policies standards and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.",

   "Discussion": "Security functions are isolated from nonsecurity functions by means of an isolation boundary implemented within a system via partitions and domains. The isolation boundary controls access to and protects the integrity of the hardware software and firmware that perform system security functions. Systems implement code separation in many ways such as through the provision of security kernels via processor rings or processor modes. For non-kernel code security function isolation is often achieved through file system protections that protect the code on disk and address space protections that protect executing code. Systems can restrict access to security functions using access control mechanisms and by implementing least privilege capabilities. While the ideal is for all code within the defined security function isolation boundary to only contain security-relevant code it is sometimes necessary to include nonsecurity functions as an exception. The isolation of security functions from nonsecurity functions can be achieved by applying the systems security engineering design principles in SA-8 including SA-8(1) SA-8(3) SA-8(4) SA-8(10) SA-8(12) SA-8(13) SA-8(14) and SA-8(18).",

The fundamental design objective is that the specific portions of systems that provide information security are of minimal size and complexity. Minimizing the number of nonsecurity functions in the security-relevant system components allows designers and implementers to focus only on those functions which are necessary to provide the desired security capability (typically access enforcement).

Nonsignature-based detection mechanisms include artificial intelligence techniques that use heuristics to detect analyze and describe the characteristics or behavior of malicious code and to provide controls against such code for which signatures do not yet exist or for which existing signatures may not be effective. Malicious code for which active signatures do not yet exist or may be ineffective includes polymorphic malicious code (i.e. code that changes signatures when it replicates). Nonsignature-based mechanisms also include reputation-based technologies.

Valid inputs are likely to vary from field to field within a software application. Applications typically follow well-defined protocols that use structured messages (i.e. commands or queries) to communicate between software modules or system components. Structured messages can contain raw or unstructured data interspersed with metadata or control information. If software applications use attacker-supplied inputs to construct structured messages without properly encoding such messages then the attacker could insert malicious commands or special characters that can cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently the module or component that receives the corrupted output will perform the wrong operations or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly.

By implementing the concept of non-persistence for selected system components organizations can provide a trusted known state computing resource for a specific time period that does not give adversaries sufficient time to exploit vulnerabilities in organizational systems or operating environments. Since the APT is a high-end sophisticated threat with regard to capability intent and targeting organizations assume that over an extended period a percentage of attacks will be successful. Non-persistent system components and services are activated as required using protected information and terminated periodically or at the end of sessions. Non-persistence increases the work factor of adversaries attempting to compromise or breach organizational systems.\nNon-persistence can be achieved by refreshing system components periodically reimaging components or using a variety of common virtualization techniques. Non-persistent services can be implemented by using virtualization techniques as part of virtual machines or as new instances of processes on physical machines (either persistent or non-persistent). The benefit of periodic refreshes of system components and services is that it does not require organizations to first determine whether compromises of components or services have occurred (something that may often be difficult to determine). The refresh of selected system components and services occurs with sufficient frequency to prevent the spread or intended impact of attacks but not with such frequency that it makes the system unstable.

Automated tools can also be used to improve the auditing of data and detect errors that may incorrectly alter personally identifiable information or incorrectly associate such information with the wrong individual. Automated capabilities backstop processes and procedures at-scale and enable more fine-grained detection and correction of data quality errors.",

Many datasets contain information about individuals that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual�s identity such as name social security number date and place of birth mother�s maiden name or biometric records. Datasets may also contain other information that is linked or linkable to an individual such as medical educational financial and employment information. Personally identifiable information is removed from datasets by trained individuals when such information is not (or no longer) necessary to satisfy the requirements envisioned for the data. For example if the dataset is only used to produce aggregate statistics the identifiers that are not needed for producing those statistics are removed. Removing identifiers improves privacy protection since information that is removed cannot be inadvertently disclosed or improperly used. Organizations may be subject to specific de-identification definitions or methods under applicable laws regulations or policies. Re-identification is a residual risk with de-identified data. Re-identification attacks can vary including combining new datasets or other improvements in data analytics. Maintaining awareness of potential attacks and evaluating for the effectiveness of the de-identification over time support the management of this residual risk.",

If the organization receives email at one of the false email addresses it knows that the database has been compromised. Moreover the organization knows that the email was sent by an unauthorized entity so any packets it includes potentially contain malicious code and that the unauthorized entity may have potentially obtained a copy of the database. Another tainting approach can include embedding false data or steganographic data in files to enable the data to be found via open-source analysis. Finally an active tainting approach can include embedding software in the data that is able to �call home� thereby alerting the organization to its �capture� and possibly its location and the path by which it was exfiltrated or removed.",

Supply chain risks can be endemic or systemic within a system element or component a system an organization a sector or the Nation. Managing supply chain risk is a complex multifaceted undertaking that requires a coordinated effort across an organization to build trust relationships and communicate with internal and external stakeholders. Supply chain risk management (SCRM) activities include identifying and assessing risks determining appropriate risk response actions developing SCRM plans to document response actions and monitoring performance against plans. The SCRM plan (at the system-level) is implementation specific providing policy implementation requirements constraints and implications. It can either be stand-alone or incorporated into system security and privacy plans. The SCRM plan addresses managing implementation and monitoring of SCRM controls and the development/sustainment of systems across the SDLC to support mission and business functions.\nBecause supply chains can differ significantly across and within organizations SCRM plans are tailored to the individual program organizational and operational contexts. Tailored SCRM plans provide the basis for determining whether a technology service system component or system is fit for purpose and as such the controls need to be tailored accordingly. Tailored SCRM plans help organizations focus their resources on the most critical mission and business functions based on mission and business requirements and their risk environment. Supply chain risk management plans include an expression of the supply chain risk tolerance for the organization acceptable supply chain risk mitigation strategies or controls a process for consistently evaluating and monitoring supply chain risk approaches for implementing and communicating the plan a description of and justification for supply chain risk mitigation measures taken and associated roles and responsibilities.

   "Discussion": "For many systems and system components especially hardware there are technical means to determine if the items are genuine or have been altered including optical and nanotechnology tagging physically unclonable functions side-channel analysis cryptographic hash verifications or digital signatures and visible anti-tamper labels or stickers. Controls can also include monitoring for out of specification performance which can be an indicator of tampering or counterfeits. Organizations may leverage supplier and contractor processes for validating that a system or component is genuine and has not been altered and for replacing a suspect system or component. Some indications of tampering may be visible and addressable before accepting delivery such as inconsistent packaging broken seals and incorrect labels. When a system or system component is suspected of being altered or counterfeit the supplier contractor or original equipment manufacturer may be able to replace the item or provide a forensic capability to determine the origin of the counterfeit or altered item. Organizations can provide training to personnel on how to identify suspicious system or component deliveries.",

   "Discussion": "Authoritative information regarding the internal composition of system components and the provenance of technology products and services provides a strong basis for trust. The validation of the internal composition and provenance of technologies products and services is referred to as the pedigree. For microelectronics this includes material composition of components. For software this includes the composition of open-source and proprietary code including the version of the component at a given point in time. Pedigrees increase the assurance that the claims suppliers assert about the internal composition and provenance of the products services and technologies they provide are valid. The validation of the internal composition and provenance can be achieved by various evidentiary artifacts or records that manufacturers and suppliers produce during the research and development design manufacturing acquisition delivery integration operations and maintenance and disposal of technology products and services. Evidentiary artifacts include but are not limited to software identification (SWID) tags software component inventory the manufacturers� declarations of platform attributes (e.g. serial numbers hardware component inventory) and measurements (e.g. firmware hashes) that are tightly bound to the hardware itself.",
